## INFO 474 Project 1

When I look through the U.S. Population dataset that is given for this assignment, I felt like it is possible to answer the question: 
“What is the difference in total U.S population between 1900 and 2000?” The visualization I chose to represent the U.S Population data 
is a stacked bar chart comparing the total population of the two years with each bar representing different age ranges. I believe that 
this visualization best showcase how much more people we have in the 2000 compared to 1900 and also how much life expectancy has 
increased. The amount of people over 80 years old (represented in light green bars) are much higher in 2000 compared to that in 1900.
